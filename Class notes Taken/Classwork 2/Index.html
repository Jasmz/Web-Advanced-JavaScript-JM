	Kung-Fu Masters utilize their own fists and feet to defeat their enemies.
	Most of the Kung-Fu Master's attacks are delivered in combos for fast and 
	very effective melee ranged blows. With such quick reflexes, 
	Kung-Fu Masters can attack and defend with ease, 
	able to react to even the most dire situation as quickly as possible. 
	They have absolutely no problem taking the advantage 
	over their enemies during battle with such speed.
